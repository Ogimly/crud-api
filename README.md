## API

Users endpoint: `api/users`

User entity:

```
{
  id: string;         // unique identifier (uuid)
  username: string;   // user's name (required)
  age: number;        // user's age (required)
  hobbies: string[];  // user's hobbies (required)
}
```

Get all users: `GET api/users`

Get user by id : `GET api/users/{userId}`

Create new user and store it in database: `POST api/users`

Update existing user: `PUT api/users/{userId}`

Delete existing user from database: `DELETE api/users/{userId}`

## Load balancer

Load balancer run and is listening for requests on `localhost:4000`

Workers run are listening for requests from load balancer on `localhost:4001` `localhost:4002` `localhost:4003` et—Å.

When user sends request to `localhost:4000`, load balancer sends this request to `localhost:4001`, next user request is sent to `localhost:4002` and so on. After sending request to last wotker load balancer starts from the first worker again (`localhost:4001`)

State of db should be consistent between different workers.

The console displays the process of run workers and redirecting requests from the load balancer to workers
